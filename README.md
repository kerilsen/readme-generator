  This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the inquirer package. It allows the user to quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. It includes prompts to ensure the user creates all the content necessary for a professional README.

  For future development, I would like to implement a recursive function to ask the user to keep entering steps for the installation section until they were finished. I also would like implement a way to upload screenshots and insert links that would convert to markdown.
